# "Hello-World"

"Hello-World" is an introductory project with Agama Lab. We will build, deploy, and test a simple password-based authentication flow using Agama and Agama Lab.

If you are interested in low-code development and eager to create your authentication flow with drag-and-drop features, then Agama Lab is the right choice for you.
