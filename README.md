# "agama-pw" 

"agama-pw" an "Hello" project for Agama Developer Studio (ADS). We will build, deploy and test a simple password-based authentication flow using [Agama](https://docs.jans.io/head/agama/introduction/) and [Agama Lab](https://cloud.gluu.org/agama-lab/dashboard/projects)

### Agama Lab

[Agama Lab](https://cloud.gluu.org/agama-lab/dashboard/projects) is an online visual editor to build authentication flows. A flow built on Agama Lab is packaged as a `.gama` project file. `.gama` package needs to be manually deployed on Janssen Server where the Agama engine will execute the flow when an authentication request is received.

Major Steps involved in this process are:

* Create Agama project using Agama Lab
* Deploying .gama package on Janssen Server
* Testing the authentication flow

### Getting Started

We will use [Agama Lab](https://cloud.gluu.org/agama-lab/dashboard/projects) to create a simple username-password based user authentication flow. This involves defining the authentication steps, designing the user interface to capture user inputs, and lastly, releasing the flow as an Agama project.

### Commonly used Bean

To obtain a managed bean inside agama flow [CdiUtil](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/blob/main/jans-core/service/src/main/java/io/jans/service/cdi/util/CdiUtil.java) is used.

1. [AuthenticationService](https://docs.jans.io/head/admin/developer/managed-beans/#1-authenticationservice)

Allow to authenticate a user or obtain the current authenticated user. To know more visit [here](https://docs.jans.io/head/admin/developer/managed-beans/#1-authenticationservice)

### Create Authentication Flow

Click on â†—

The flow authoring view will open with a blank canvas. To start creating the flow, we need to create a Flow File. To do that,

`Right-click` on code and then select `New > Flow File`



### Web Template

To design user interface. We use Freemaker Template. There have multiple default template. In the RRF configuration step, we mentioned `login.ftlh` to render the login page elements. We need to add `login.ftlh` to the Agama project so that the flow can use during the flow execution. Use the steps below to create the page.
